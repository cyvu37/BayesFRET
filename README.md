**BayesFRET** is a Python GUI program for estimating the number and behavior of distinct conformational states from intrinsically disordered molecules (ex. enzymes, Holliday junctions). The observed molecules must come from single-molecule FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) experiments that use the surface-immobilized method, or from surface-immobilized smFRET experiments.

The program implements an experiment-adjusted Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) to process time-binned photon intensities of the donor and acceptor dyes, or the data source, from the smFRET experiment. Each set of simulations produces a directory of graphs and numerical data. [My thesis paper](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11801/3955) provides an in-depth analysis of the math and process behind this program.

**Data Source**: Time-binned photon intensities (TXT) of the donor and acceptor dyes from a surface-immobilized smFRET experiment.

**Method**: Four controlled Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations within an experiment-adjusted HDP-HMM.

**Results**: A directory of graphs (PNG) and numerical data (Pickle, TXT files).


# Installation
1. **Compatible Operating Systems**: Successful testing on Windows 10/11 and macOS. Not yet for Linux.
1. **Python Interpreter & Environment**
    * Compatible versions: 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
    * This documentation will assume the Python call function is `python`.
1. **Download Files**: Assign a directory specifically for the files of this program (ex. `C:\Users\Cyvu37\Documents\BayesFRET`). 
    * Make sure the parent directory of the program directory (ex. `C:\Users\Cyvu37\Documents`) doesn't require administrator access. BayesFRET must be able to produce subdirectories and files!
    * Processing power may vary based on the directory's location.
1. **Install Packages**: [chime](https://github.com/MaxHalford/chime), [darkdetect](https://github.com/albertosottile/darkdetect), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/), [scipy](https://scipy.org/)
    * If internet is available when BayesFRET opens, the app will auto-run the `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` command to verify the required packages. Make sure you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) and [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) in your Python environment.
    * The app will also auto-check your Python system for the required packages and the current directory for file dependencies (ex. `code01_classes.py`). Anything missing will cause the program to close.


# The Control Panel
The program can either use data from real experiments ("Experimental") or it can run by itself using randomly generated data simulating data from an smFRET experiment ("Synthetic"). Either way, the program will run the four MCMC simulations one at a time and visualize the results. Graphs and numerical data are saved as soon as they are produced. Refer to Section 3.1 of [my thesis paper](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11801/3955) for more details.


## Data Source Requirements
* **Synthetic Mode**: None. The program generates its own data and compares it with the MCMC simulations.
* **Experimental Mode**
    * 2 text/CSV files, each with a single array of numerical values separated by whitespace/commas.
        * 1 for the intensities of the *acceptor* dye throughout the experiment.
        * 1 for the intensities of the *donor* dye throughout the experiment.
    * Parameters of the experiment for the Options section of the GUI.


# Running the Program
When BayesFRET runs the simulations, the program stores the information inputted through the GUI into a directory with the exact timestamp of when the run started, or **the active directory**. 

BayesFRET uses a Universal class to store various miscellaneous data, including absolute URIs to their original directories. After the program finishes its run, data from the Universal class is saved to replicate the program's output. See the [Interpreting the Results](#interpreting-the-results) section for more information.

## Avoid These Things

* Don't modify the BayesFRET or active directories, including their URIs and internal files, while BayesFRET runs the simulations!
* Don't interact with the GUI or its windows while the simulations are running! This version doesn't support multithreading yet.


# Interpreting the Results

Each pickle file (`.p`) produced by this program contains data that can be instantly used in a Python environment. However, they contain custom Python classes from `code01_classes.py`. Copy `code01_classes.py` to your current directory to access the documentation of the Python classes. An advanced code editor like Visual Studio Code with extensions can provide the user with previews of documentation regarding those custom classes.

## Importing the Data

The following commands import all of the data produced by a run from the program:

```
import os, pickle

# Full directory path.
DIR = "...{os.sep}BayesFRET_syn - 2024 04 23, 13 12 01 614687"

# Import documentation.
# For this line to work, you must have a copy of `code01_classes.py` in your current directory.
from code01_classes import Chain_History, Params, True_Samples, Universal

# Import the Universal class (`U`).
with open( os.join( DIR, "BayesFRET_Universal_class.p" ), "rb" ) as file:
    U: Universal = pickle.load(file)

# Import the parameters class (`params`).
# If synthetic, also import the true samples class (`TS`).
with open( os.join( DIR, "BayesFRET_data_params_and_true.p" ), "rb" ) as file:
    if U.is_syn:
        X = pickle.load(file)
        params: Params = X[0]
        TS: True_Samples = X[1]
    else:
        params: Params = pickle.load(file)

# Import the sampling history for each simulation (`S[0]` - `S[3]`).
S: list[Chain_History] = []
FILENAMES = [os.join( DIR, "BayesFRET_data_sim_{i}_history.p" ) for i in U.list_seeds]
for v in U.range_seeds:
    with open(FILENAMES[v], "rb") as f:
        S.append( pickle.load(f) )
```

* `Chain_History`: History of samples regarding key variables throughout the MCMC simulation.
    * Experimental + synthetic data: Found in `BayesFRET_data_sim_{i}_history.p` where `{i}` is the RNG seed value.
* `Params`: Fixed parameters such as the options from the Algorithm Settings, Photoemission Priors, and Photophysics Priors sections of the GUI. 
    * Experimental data: Found in `BayesFRET_data_params.p`.
    * Synthetic data: Found in `BayesFRET_data_params_and_true.p`.
* `True_Samples`: Variables used in making the synthetic data from `code02_setup.py`.
    * Synthetic data only: Found in `BayesFRET_data_params_and_true.p`.
* `Universal`: Holds all other miscellaneous variables, including...
    * Filenames (not filepaths) of the Chain_History pickle files (`U.filenames`).\*
    * List of the unique RNG seed values (`U.list_seeds`).
    * List of the RNG classes corresponding to each RNG seed value (`U.RNGs`).
    * Number of Posterior Quantiles (`U.Q`).
    * The full path of the active directory (`U.DIR_ACTIVE`)\* and a function to merge the path with a filename (`U.func_getActivePath(...)`).\*
    * The full path of the program's original directory (`U.DIR_PROGRAM`).\*

\*Changes in a filename or a directory path affect these variables and functions. The following code demonstrates how to save those changes in the Universal file (`BayesFRET_Universal_class.p`).

```
# >> How to Handle Name Changes <<
# directory name change: DIR2 --> "...\BayesFRET_syn FINAL"
# Filename change for 3rd seed: 'BayesFRET_data_sim_627_history.p' --> 'BayesFRET_627.p'

DIR2 = "...{os.sep}BayesFRET_syn FINAL"
with open( os.join( DIR2, "BayesFRET_Universal_class.p" ), "rb" ) as file:
    U: Universal = pickle.load(file)
U.DIR_ACTIVE = DIR2                  # This updates the `FILEPATH` function.
U.filenames[2] = 'BayesFRET_627.p'  # This allows you to use the previous for loop to iterate all filenames.
...
with open(U.FILEPATH( os.join( DIR2, "BayesFRET_Universal_class.p" ) ), "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump( U, file )
```


## Usage Examples

1. Using the default RNG seeds (5, 44, 356, 9918), use the following commands to extract the FRET efficiencies `eff` of each unique state at the last MCMC iteration `n=1000` for the MCMC simulation with RNG seed 5 (`S[0]`).

```
n = 1000

# The set of unique conformational states at the MCMC iteration n=1000.
ks = S[0].K_set[n]

# Only extract the FRET efficiencies (`eff`) of the unique conformational states (`ks`) at n=1000. Results between 0 and 1.
return S[0].eff[n, ks]
```

2. Find the evaluated conformational states at time t (`st`) of the acceptor dye's photoemission rates $\lambda^A_{s_t}$ at the MCMC iteration `n=649` for the MCMC simulation with RNG seed 9918 (`S[3]`).

```
return S[3].lam_A[ S[3].st[649] ]
```
